      # HACK(mihe): Framework bundles contain symlinks to help with supporting multiple versions in
      # a bundle. This can result in multiple physical duplicates of the bundled library when we do
      # things like zip them, push them to source control or just deal with them in general on
      # platforms that don't do well with symlinks, like Windows. So to mitigate this we replace the
      # symlinks with the actual files and remove any duplicates.
